# UnityShowerTrauma
In Shower Trauma, you play as a young child who is terrified of bathing due to a past trauma. Each day, you must face this fear and survive terrifying encounters in the bathroom, where malevolent forces manifest as monsters, shadows, and other horrors. The evil in the bathroom grows stronger with each passing day, but you must clean yourself or face even worse consequences.

- Survival Mechanics: Each shower or bath is a roguelike level where you must avoid or combat manifestations of your trauma, using limited resources like soap, water, or light to fend off the horrors.
- Psychological Horror: The game focuses on the mental strain of a abused child. As the trauma intensifies, hallucinations blur the line between what is real and imagined.
- Randomized Encounters: Every time you enter the shower, the layout, enemies, and challenges are different, keeping the you on edge.
- Progressive Fear: Over time, the childâ€™s trauma intensifies, and the dangers become more severe, with deeper mysteries to unravel about the origin of their fear.
