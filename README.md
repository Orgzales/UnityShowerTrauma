# UnityShowerTrauma
In Shower Trauma, you play as a young child who is terrified of bathing due to a past trauma. Each day, you must face this fear and survive terrifying encounters in the bathroom, where malevolent forces manifest as monsters, shadows, and other horrors. The evil in the bathroom grows stronger with each passing day, but you must clean yourself or face even worse consequences.

- Survival Mechanics: Each shower or bath is a roguelike level where you must avoid or combat manifestations of your trauma, using limited resources like soap, water, or light to fend off the horrors.
- Psychological Horror: The game focuses on the mental strain of a abused child. As the trauma intensifies, hallucinations blur the line between what is real and imagined.
- Randomized Encounters: Every time you enter the shower, the layout, enemies, and challenges are different, keeping the you on edge.
- Progressive Fear: Over time, the childâ€™s trauma intensifies, and the dangers become more severe, with deeper mysteries to unravel about the origin of their fear.

## Plans To Do

 - ðŸ—¸ Create Default FPS Controller 
 - ðŸ—¸ Create default scene for template
	- ðŸ—¸ Make layout for bathroom
	- ðŸ—¸  Make doors, vents, walls, and roof
	- ðŸ—¸  Create blocks for testing now
# Step 2:
- Create Event manager Script
	- ðŸ—¸ Dirty and Instanity bar
		- ðŸ—¸ When in shower the dirty bar decreases 
		- ðŸ—¸ When in bathroom Instanity bar rises, Only when the shower started
		- ðŸ—¸ When out of shower, dirty increases 
	- ðŸ—¸ Washing face decreases the Dirty bar rapidly but increases the chance for somethine to happen 
		- ðŸ—¸ Make invisble colliders:
			- ðŸ—¸ Enter shower area 
			- ðŸ—¸ Washing face to press Each
			- ðŸ—¸ Turning the shower on/off
	- ðŸ—¸ Debug everything for logs 
# Step 3:
- Make Interatiable system
	- ðŸ—¸ Make a hud with dot in middle for now
	- ðŸ—¸ Whenever player looks at interactable object, display hud text and outline
	- ðŸ—¸ Each object will have a script object 
		- ðŸ—¸ When pressing shower, should wash face for step 4
		- ðŸ—¸ When looking at shower, should turn on/off 
			- ðŸ—¸ This will start the cleaning count down 
	
# Step 4:
- ðŸ—¸ Create Script for Blink mechanic
	- ðŸ—¸ Make object overlay for pressing "E"
	- ðŸ—¸ Player screen should go black for a minute 
	- ðŸ—¸ Create UI for "Press E to wash Face" 
- ðŸ—¸ Washing face should decrease dirty level
	- ðŸ—¸ Only able to do it if the shower is on
	- ðŸ—¸ Decrese by 20 for now 
- Event System:
	- Insane Value determines if event happens or not:
		- ðŸ—¸ If event happens, Dirty value determines what kind of event happens
		- Based on Dirty Value Percentile
			- ðŸ—¸ 100%-75% (percentile 1):
				- Higher Chance: Instance Events
				- Lower Chance: Level changing Event & Medium events
			- 75%-50% (percentile 2): 
				- Higher Chance: Small events 
				- Lower Chance: Level Chaning Event & Instance Events
			- 50%-25% (percentile 3):
				- Higher Chnace: Medium Events 
				- Lower Chance: instance and small events 
			- 25%-0%:
				- Higher chance: Level changing events 
				- lower: small and medium 
		- Chance of each event happening by default:
			- Instance Event: 50%
			- Small event: 25%
			- Medium: 15%
			- Level Changing: 10%
			
	- Number of Days based on chance rate of what kind of event is happening
		- Chance = Days + insane rate chance 

	
# Step 5:
- When washing face, random events have a chance of happening

		- Every 25 percentile, have to have player wash face to continue
			- Going backwards when getting more dirty will have to wash again
			- When 0f, player would need to grab towel and can't get dirty 
			- Player must grab a towel to finish the night 
			- When hit the min or max of bar, the art bar stops it
	- Insane Bar:
		- Gradually goes down, washing face brings it up more 
		- Every 25% a guraentee event happens at random
