Start: over time the player will find ghost children hidden in areas for events

If the player gives their own snaity to them and increase their olds of events,  the ghost will be saved.

Over time a devil will hunt and find the player, once they do the devil will not try to attack them but will forgive them and try to make a contract 

Contract: self scrafice themselves to not save a certain amount of ghost forever. This number will get higher as the player continues. 

Once the number hits max, the player will be given one final warning

If the player at all decides yes, they will be transform as a spirit watching over everyone, including the parent that watch their child died

If the player doesn,t in the end the devil will shame the player in the end and the player will be left with nothing to do for the rest of the game.
